            content: `As a sign of Talut (Saul) being appointed king, the sacred chest (Tabut) carried by angels came to him. Talut tested his army at a river; except for those who drank only a handful, others failed the test. The believers fought with the conviction that "a small force can overcome a large force by Allah's permission." Dawud (A.S.) killed Jalut.`,

            content: `There is no compulsion in the acceptance of Islam, as the right path has been clearly distinguished from the wrong path. Whoever rejects false deities (Taghut) and believes in Allah has grasped a firm handhold that will never break.`,
