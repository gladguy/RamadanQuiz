            content: `Allah does not like the public utterance of evil speech except by one who has been wronged. Forgiving the evil done by someone or performing good openly or secretly brings great reward from Allah. Allah is Oft-Forgiving and All-Powerful.`,

            content: `They made strange demands to Musa (A.S.), asking for a book to be sent down directly from heaven. They were punished for worshipping the calf, violating the Sabbath (Sabt) law, and breaking their covenant with Allah.`,

            content: `Allah clarifies that Isa (A.S.) was neither killed nor crucified. It was made to appear so to the Jews. In fact, Allah raised him up to Himself. On the Day of Resurrection, he will be a witness against them.`,

            content: `Allah sent revelation (Wahi) to Muhammad (S.A.W.) just as He sent it to previous Prophets such as Nuh, Ibrahim, Isma'il, Isa, Ayyub, and Dawud (A.S.). These Messengers were sent so that people would have no excuse before Allah in the Hereafter.`,

            content: `When preparing for prayer, wash the face and hands, wipe the head (Masah), and wash the feet. If water is unavailable, Allah permits 'Tayammum' with clean earth. Allah does not wish to place you in hardship but intends to purify you.`,

            content: `O believers! Stand firm for justice as witnesses for Allah. Let not the hatred of a people lead you to injustice. Acting with justice is closest to piety (Taqwa).`,

            content: `Those who say, "Allah is the Messiah, son of Maryam," have certainly disbelieved. The Qur'an strongly condemns the doctrine of the 'Trinity' (worshipping three besides Allah). Isa (A.S.) was but a Messenger; many Messengers passed away before him.`,
