Slide 1: Trust and Justice
Allah commands you to deliver trusts to those to whom they are due and to judge with justice when you judge between people.

Slide 2: Obedience to Authority
Obey Allah, obey the Messenger, and those in authority among you. If you differ, refer it to Allah and the Messenger.

Slide 3: Sanctity of Life
Do not kill yourselves or one another. Allah is toward you Merciful. Whoever does so out of aggression and injustice will be cast into Fire.

Slide 4: Reconciliation in Marriage
If there is a fear of a breach between a couple, appoint mediators from both families to attempt reconciliation. Allah loves harmony.

Slide 5: Protecting the Soul
Allah does not forgive associating partners with Him (Shirk), but He forgives anything else for whom He wills.

Slide 6: Honesty in Testimony
Stand out firmly for justice as witnesses to Allah, even if it is against yourselves, your parents, or your kin.

Slide 7: Migrating for Faith
Those whose souls the angels take while they were wronging themselves will be asked, "Was not the earth of Allah spacious enough for you to emigrate?"

Slide 8: Prayer during Travel and Fear
Allah has made the religion easy. During travel or fear, the prayer can be shortened (Qasr) and performed in a simplified manner.

Slide 9: Character of Hypocrites
Hypocrites seek to deceive Allah, but He is deceiving them. They stand for prayer lazily, only to be seen by people.
