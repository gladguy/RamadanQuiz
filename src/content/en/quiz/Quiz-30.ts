      content: `Lesson: Juz 30 - The Great News and the Short Surahs

Slide 1: Surah An-Naba - The Great News
Allah asks about the "great news" of the Resurrection. He points to His signs: the earth as a bed and the mountains as pegs to stabilize it.

Slide 2: Surah An-Nazi'at and Abasa
These Surahs warn about the Day of Judgment and the creation of man from a small drop. "On that Day, a man will flee from his brother, and his mother and his father."

Slide 3: End of the World
Surah At-Takwir and Al-Infitar describe the cosmic events: the sun being wrapped up, the stars falling, and the seas being boiled or erupted.

Slide 4: Surah Al-Mutaffifin - Fairness in Business
Woe to those who give less in weight and measure! When they take measure from people, they take in full, but when they give by measure or weight, they cause loss.

Slide 5: Surah Al-Buruj and At-Tariq
Surah Al-Buruj tells of the People of the Ditch who were persecuted for their faith. Surah At-Tariq mentions that every soul has over it a protector (angel).

Slide 6: Surah Al-A'la and Al-Ghashiyah
"He has certainly succeeded who purifies himself and remembers the name of his Lord and prays." The Hereafter is better and more enduring.

Slide 7: Surah Al-Fajr and Al-Balad
Allah swears by the dawn and the ten nights (of Dhul-Hijjah). He created man to live in hardship but also gave him eyes, a tongue, and two lips to find the right path.

Slide 8: Surah Ash-Shams and Al-Layl
Success is for the one who purifies his soul, and failure is for the one who corrupts it.

Slide 9: Surah Ad-Duha and Ash-Sharh
Allah reassures the Prophet (S.A.W.) that He has not forsaken him. "Indeed, with hardship, there is ease."

Slide 10: The Concluding Surahs
From Surah Al-Alaq (the first revelation: "Iqra") to Surah An-Nas, these short Surahs emphasize faith, sincerity (Ikhlas), and seeking protection with the Lord of mankind.
