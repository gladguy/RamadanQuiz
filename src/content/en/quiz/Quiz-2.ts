The Muslim community is designated as a middle community to be witnesses over mankind.

Only pure things are allowed. Carrion, blood, pork, and meat dedicated to other than Allah are forbidden, except in cases of absolute necessity.

Marriage with polytheists is prohibited. Divorce laws include a three-month waiting period and provisions for breastfeeding.
