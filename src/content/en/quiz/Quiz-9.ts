Musa (A.S.) was sent with clear signs and miracles to Pharaoh, who was a tyrant claiming divinity. Musa (A.S.) demanded the release of the Children of Israel.

The magicians recognized the truth when Musa's staff swallowed their illusions. They surrendered to the Lord of the worlds despite Pharaoh's threats.
