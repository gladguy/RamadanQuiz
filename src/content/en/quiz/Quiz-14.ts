      content: `Lesson: Juz 14 - Divine Protection and Natural Signs

Slide 1: Protection of the Qur'an
"Indeed, it is We who sent down the Qur'an and indeed, We will be its guardian." Allah has taken the responsibility of protecting the revelation from any change.

Slide 2: Arrogance of Iblees
Allah mentions the creation of humans from clay. Iblees refused to prostrate due to arrogance and was expelled, swearing to mislead mankind except the sincere servants.

Slide 3: The People of Hijr
The people of Hijr (Thamud) were skillful in carving secure homes from the mountains, but their skills could not save them from Allah's decree when they rejected the truth.

Slide 4: Surah An-Nahl - Blessings of Allah
This Surah is also called the "Chapter of Blessings." It details the many favors Allah has bestowed—cattle, rain, crops, and the alternation of night and day.

Slide 5: Guidance for Mankind
"And if you should count the favors of Allah, you could not enumerate them. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful." Gratitude is the proper response to His gifts.

Slide 6: The Miracle of Bees
Allah inspired the bee to build cells in mountains and trees and produce honey of varying colors. In it is healing (Shifa) for mankind.

Slide 7: Animals as Lessons
In cattle, there is a lesson. From what is in their bellies—between excretion and blood—Allah produces pure milk, palatable to drinkers.

Slide 8: Justice and Excellence
"Indeed, Allah orders justice and good conduct and giving to relatives and forbids immorality and bad conduct and oppression."

Slide 9: Manners of Calling to Allah
Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good instruction, and argue with them in a way that is best.

Slide 10: Firmness and Patience
"And be patient, and your patience is not but through Allah." Allah is with those who fear Him and those who are doers of good.
