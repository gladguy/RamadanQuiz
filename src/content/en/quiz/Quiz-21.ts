Slide 1: Surah Ar-Rum - The Roman Victory
This Surah begins with the prophecy that although the Romans were defeated, they would be victorious again within a few years. Allah grants victory to whom He wills.

Slide 2: Signs in Nature and Marriage
Allah's signs include the creation of heavens and earth, the diversity of languages and colors, and the creation of spouses to find tranquility and love with one another.

Slide 3: Corruption on Land and Sea
Corruption has appeared throughout the land and sea by what the hands of people have earned, so that Allah may let them taste some of what they have done.

Slide 4: Advice of Luqman (A.S.)
Luqman (A.S.) advised his son: "O my son, do not associate anything with Allah. Indeed, association [with Him] is great injustice."

Slide 5: Kindness to Parents
Allah commands kindness to parents, especially the mother who bore her child in weakness upon weakness and whose weaning is in two years. "Be grateful to Me and to your parents."

Slide 6: Manners and Humility
Luqman (A.S.) further advised: "Do not turn your cheek in contempt toward people and do not walk through the earth exultantly. Indeed, Allah does not like any self-deluded boaster."

Slide 7: Moderate Speech
"Be moderate in your pace and lower your voice; indeed, the most disagreeable of sounds is the voice of donkeys."

Slide 8: The Five Hidden Things
Allah alone knows the Hour, sends down the rain, knows what is in the wombs, what a soul will earn tomorrow, and in what land a soul will die.

Slide 9: Surah As-Sajdah - Creation from Clay
Allah created the heavens and earth in six days. He began the creation of man from clay, then made his offspring from a drop of fluid.

Slide 10: Battle of the Trench (Ahzab)
The believers were tested with a great trial when the enemy forces gathered around Madinah. Allah sent a strong wind and unseen armies to drive them away.
