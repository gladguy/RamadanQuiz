            content: `Based on the content of the first file (Juz 1 - Surah Al-Fatiha and Surah Al-Baqarah verses 1 to 141), here is a 10-slide curriculum followed by 5 multiple-choice questions:

Quran Lesson: Juz 1 - Introduction and Fundamental Beliefs

Slide 1: Surah Al-Fatiha (The Opening)
It is the first chapter of the Qur'an, known as "The Opening."
This is the most important Surah recited in every Rak'ah of every prayer.
It praises Allah as the Lord of the worlds, the Most Gracious, and the Especially Merciful.

Slide 2: Names of Allah (Ar-Rahman, Ar-Rahim)
Ar-Rahman: Refers to Allah's infinite mercy which is general to all creations in this world (without distinguishing between the good and the bad).
Ar-Rahim: Refers specifically to the exclusive mercy Allah bestows upon the believers (Mu'mineen) in the Hereafter.

Slide 3: Surah Al-Baqarah (The Cow)
This is the second and longest chapter of the Qur'an.
It is named after the historical event where the people during the time of Musa (A.S.) were commanded to sacrifice a cow.
It serves as a complete guide for those who fear Allah (Muttaqeen).

Slide 4: Characteristics of the Muttaqeen (The God-fearing)
They believe in the Unseen (Ghayb/Iman) which is beyond the senses.
They establish prayer (Salah) properly.
They spend in the right way from the wealth Allah has provided them.
They firmly believe in the previous scriptures and the Hereafter.

Slide 5: Signs of the Hypocrites (Munafiq)
They outwardly claim to believe but remain disbelievers within their hearts.
They say, "We are only reformers," but in reality, they are the ones who spread mischief.
There is a disease (hypocrisy) in their hearts.

Slide 6: The Beginning of Human Creation (Adam A.S.)
Allah told the angels that He was going to create a representative (Khalifa) on earth.
He created the first human, Adam (A.S.), and taught him the names of all things.
On the basis of knowledge, Adam (A.S.) proved to be superior to the angels.

Slide 7: The Arrogance of Iblees
When Allah commanded the angels to prostrate (Sajdah) to Adam (A.S.), the angels obeyed.
However, Iblees refused out of arrogance and became a disbeliever. This marked the beginning of the struggle between mankind and Shaitan.

Slide 8: Blessings Bestowed upon Bani Israel
Allah saved them from the tyranny of Pharaoh (Fir'aun).
He sent down food for them from the heavens called 'Mann and Salwa.'
Despite these many blessings, they were often ungrateful and violated commands.

Slide 9: The Sacrifice of Ibrahim (A.S.)
Ibrahim (A.S.) was subjected to many severe trials, and he was successful in all of them.
He and his son Isma'il (A.S.) together built the Holy Kaaba (the House of Allah).
They prayed to make the Kaaba a place of purity and worship.

Slide 10: The True Religion (Islam)
Islam means "complete submission to the will of Allah."
This is the fundamental religion taught by all Prophets from Adam (A.S.) to Muhammad (S.A.W.).
Success in the sight of Allah is not based on caste or race, but on faith and performing righteous deeds.
