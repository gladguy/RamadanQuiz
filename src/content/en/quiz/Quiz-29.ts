      content: `Lesson: Juz 29 - Sovereignty and Character

Slide 1: Surah Al-Mulk - Sovereignty of Allah
"Blessed is He in whose hand is dominion, and He is over all things competent—[He] who created death and life to test you [as to] which of you is best in deed."

Slide 2: Flawless Creation
Allah created the seven heavens in layers. "You do not see in the creation of the Merciful any inconsistency. So return your vision [to the sky]; do you see any breaks?"

Slide 3: Surah Al-Qalam - Great Character
Allah addresses the Prophet (S.A.W.): "And indeed, you are of a great moral character." The character of the Prophet (S.A.W.) was the Qur'an itself.

Slide 4: The Day of Resurrection
Surah Al-Haqqah and Al-Ma'arij describe the terrors of the Last Day. On that day, no friend will ask about a friend, though they will see each other. A day on that day will be as fifty thousand years.

Slide 5: Surah Nuh - The Call to Guidance
Nuh (A.S.) called his people night and day, in secret and in public, but they only increased in flight. He reminded them of Allah's signs: the rain, the wealth, the children, and the heavens.

Slide 6: Surah Al-Jinn - The Unseen Believers
A group of jinn listened to the Qur'an and said, "Indeed, we have heard an amazing Qur'an. It guides to the right course, and we have believed in it."

Slide 7: Surah Al-Muzzammil and Al-Muddaththir
These Surahs address the Prophet (S.A.W.) in his early stages of prophethood, commanding him to stand in prayer at night and to arise and warn the people.

Slide 8: Value of the Night Prayer
"Indeed, the hours of the night are more effective for concurrence [of heart and tongue] and more suitable for words."

Slide 9: Surah Al-Qiyamah - Reconstruction of Man
Allah is capable of bringing the dead back to life. "Yes. [We are] Able [even] to proportion his fingertips (fingerprints)."

Slide 10: Surah Al-Insan - The Human State
Allah created man from a mixed drop to test him and made him hearing and seeing. He guided him to the way, whether he be grateful or ungrateful.
