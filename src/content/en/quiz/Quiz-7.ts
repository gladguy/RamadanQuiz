Slide 1: Nearness of Christians
You will find the nearest of people in affection to the believers those who say, "We are Christians." This is because among them are priests and monks and because they are not arrogant.

Slide 2: Expiation for Oaths
If you break an unintentional oath, the expiation is feeding or clothing ten needy people, freeing a slave, or fasting for three days.

Slide 3: Prohibiting Intoxicants
Shaitan seeks to cause animosity and hatred through alcohol and gambling and to avert you from the remembrance of Allah and prayer.

Slide 4: Hunting in Ihram
Hunting land animals is prohibited during the state of Ihram for Hajj or Umrah, as a trial from Allah. Sea food, however, is lawful.

Slide 5: Miracles of Isa (A.S.)
Allah bestowed miracles upon Isa (A.S.)—creating a bird from clay, healing the blind and leper, and bringing the dead to life—all by the permission of Allah.

Slide 6: Disciples (Hawariyyun)
The disciples said, "We believe in Allah and bear witness that we are Muslims." They asked for a table (Ma'idah) from heaven as a sign.

Slide 7: Avoiding Mockery
Do not insult those they worship besides Allah, lest they insult Allah in enmity without knowledge.

Slide 8: Signs of Creation
Allah brings the living out of the dead and the dead out of the living. He is the Cleaver of the dawn and has made the night for rest.

Slide 9: Guidance and Jinn
Allah created the Jinn and mankind to worship Him. Some Jinn listen to the Qur'an and believe in its guidance.

Slide 10: Determination of Truth
Say, "Is the blind equivalent to the seeing? Then will you not give thought?" Truth and falsehood are clearly distinguished for those who reflect.
