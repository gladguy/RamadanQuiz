      content: `Lesson: Juz 23 - Signs in Nature and Stories of Prophets

Slide 1: Surah Ya-Sin - Signs in the Heavens
"And the sun runs [on course] toward its stopping point. That is the determination of the Exalted in Might, the Knowing." Allah also ordained phases for the moon until it returns like an old, dry date stalk.

Slide 2: Orbits of Celestial Bodies
"It is not allowable for the sun to reach the moon, nor does the night overtake the day, but each, in an orbit, is swimming." This flawless system is a sign of Allah's perfect design.

Slide 3: Signs on the Earth
A sign for people is the dead earth which Allah brings to life and from which He produces grain that they eat. He also creates gardens of palm trees and grapevines.

Slide 4: The Last Trumpet
When the Trumpet is blown, people will come out of their graves and say, "Woe to us! Who has raised us up from our sleeping place?" This is what the Merciful promised.

Slide 5: Surah As-Saffat - Ibrahim (A.S.) and the Sacrifice
Ibrahim (A.S.) was willing to sacrifice his son in obedience to Allah's command. Allah replaced his son with a great sacrifice (a ram) and saved him.

Slide 6: Story of Ilyas (A.S.)
Ilyas (A.S.) called his people to worship Allah alone and leave the idol 'Baal'. He was among the righteous servants of Allah.

Slide 7: Story of Lut (A.S.) and Yunus (A.S.)
Allah saved Lut (A.S.) and his family from the punishment. Yunus (A.S.) was swallowed by a large fish and saved when he glorified Allah in the darkness.

Slide 8: Surah Sad - The Patience of Ayyub (A.S.)
Ayyub (A.S.) was tested with severe illness and loss. He remained patient and prayed to Allah. Allah told him to strike the ground with his foot, and a cool spring of water came forth for him to wash and drink.

Slide 9: Wisdom of Dawud and Sulayman (A.S.)
Dawud (A.S.) and Sulayman (A.S.) were gifted with great wisdom, kingdom, and the ability to understand the praises of mountains and birds.

Slide 10: Surah Az-Zumar - Creation of the Universe
Allah created the heavens and earth in truth. He wraps the night over the day and wraps the day over the night and has subjected the sun and the moon.
