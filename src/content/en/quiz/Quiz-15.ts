      content: `Lesson: Juz 15 - The Night Journey and the People of the Cave

Slide 1: Al-Isra (The Night Journey)
"Glory be to Him who took His servant by night from Masjid al-Haram to Masjid al-Aqsa." This miraculous journey demonstrated Allah's power and the high status of the Prophet (S.A.W.).

Slide 2: Rights of Parents
Allah has ordained that you worship none but Him and that you be kind to parents. Do not even say "Uff" (an expression of irritation) to them, nor shout at them, but speak to them with honor.

Slide 3: Ethical Guidelines
Do not walk arrogantly on the earth; you cannot tear the earth apart nor reach the mountains in height. Be moderate in spending—neither stingy nor extravagant.

Slide 4: Accountability
"Every human being's fate We have fastened around his neck, and on the Day of Resurrection We shall bring out for him a book which he will find wide open."

Slide 5: The Qur'an is a Cure
"And We send down of the Qur'an that which is a healing and a mercy for the believers."

Slide 6: Challenge to Mankind and Jinn
If all of mankind and jinn were to gather to produce the like of this Qur'an, they could not produce the like of it, even if they assisted one another.

Slide 7: Surah Al-Kahf - The People of the Cave
A group of young men fled to a cave to protect their faith from a tyrannical king. Allah caused them to sleep for 309 years and preserved them as a sign of His power.

Slide 8: Saying "Insha' Allah"
"And never say of anything, 'Indeed, I will do that tomorrow,' except [adding], 'If Allah wills' (Insha' Allah)."

Slide 9: Parable of the Two Gardens
The story of two men: one was given two beautiful gardens but became arrogant and ungrateful, while the other remained humble and reminded him that all power belongs to Allah.

Slide 10: Temporary Life
The life of this world is like water sent down from the sky; the plants of the earth absorb it, but then they become dry stalks which the winds scatter.
