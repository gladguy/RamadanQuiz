      content: `Lesson: Juz 25 - Consultation and Divine Revelation

Slide 1: Knowledge of Allah
"No fruits emerge from their sheaths, nor does a female conceive or give birth except with His knowledge." Everything in existence is under His constant.

Slide 2: Surah Ash-Shura - Principle of Consultation
"And those who have responded to their lord and established prayer and whose affair is [determined by] consultation (Shura) among themselves." Consultation is a core Islamic value.

Slide 3: Evil and Forgiveness
"The recompense for an evil is an evil like it, but whoever pardons and makes reconciliation—his reward is from Allah. Indeed, He does not like wrongdoers."

Slide 4: Diversity of Provision
Allah gives to whom He wills whatever He wills. He grants to whom He wills females, and He grants to whom He wills males, or He makes them both males and females, and He renders whom He wills barren.

Slide 5: Surah Az-Zukhruf - The Gold Ornaments
This Surah warns against being deceived by the temporary glitter of this world, such as gold ornaments. Wealth and status do not determine a person's value in the sight of Allah.

Slide 6: Mercy of the Lord
"Is it they who distribute the mercy of your Lord? It is We who have apportioned among them their livelihood in the life of this world and have raised some of them above others in degrees [of rank]."

Slide 7: Surah Ad-Dukhan - The Blessed Night
"Indeed, We sent it down during a blessed night (Laylatun Mubaraka). Indeed, We were to warn [mankind]." This refers to the night the Qur'an was revealed.

Slide 8: Destruction of Pharaoh
When Pharaoh and his people were destroyed for their arrogance and disbelief after rejecting clear signs, "the heaven and the earth did not weep for them, nor were they reprieved."

Slide 9: Food of the Sinners
The tree of Zaqqum will be the food of the sinful. Like murky oil (molten copper), it boils in their bellies like the boiling of scalding water.

Slide 10: Surah Al-Jathiyah - The Kneeling
"And you will see every nation kneeling [from fear]. Every nation will be called to its record [and told], 'Today you will be recompensed for what you used to do.'"
