Slide 1: Distribution of Spoils
One-fifth (Khumus) of the spoils belongs to Allah, the Messenger, his relatives, orphans, the needy, and the traveler.

Slide 2: Firmness in Battle
Believers are commanded to be firm when meeting an enemy and to remember Allah much. Do not dispute, or you will lose heart and your strength will depart.

Slide 3: Peace and Reconciliation
If the enemy inclines toward peace, then incline toward it also and trust in Allah. He is the Hearing, the Knowing.

Slide 4: Unity of Believers
Allah joined the hearts of the believers together. Even if you had spent all that is in the earth, you could not have joined their hearts, but Allah did.

Slide 5: Surah At-Tawbah (Repentance)
This Surah begins without 'Bismillah' and focuses on the declaration of disassociation from those who broke their covenants.

Slide 6: Maintenance of Mosques
The mosques of Allah are only to be maintained by those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, establish prayer, and give Zakat.

Slide 7: Helping the Messenger
If you do not help him, Allah has already helped him when he was driven out by the disbelievers and was the second of two in the cave (Thawr).

Slide 8: The Lesson of Hunayn
On the day of Hunayn, your great numbers made you proud but they did not avail you at all. Allah sent down His tranquility and unseen forces.

Slide 9: The Hypocrites and Tabuk
The hypocrites made excuses to avoid the difficult journey to Tabuk, even warning others not to go out in the heat. The fire of Hell is far hotter.

Slide 10: Sadaqah (Charity)
Charity (Sadaqah) is only for the poor, the needy, those employed to collect it, those whose hearts are to be reconciled, for freeing slaves, for those in debt, for the cause of Allah, and for the traveler.
