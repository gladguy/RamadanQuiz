Slide 1: Never Despair of Mercy
"Say, 'O My servants who have transgressed against themselves [by sinning], do not despair of the mercy of Allah. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful.'"

Slide 2: Surrender Before it's Late
"And return [in repentance] to your Lord and submit to Him before the punishment comes upon you; then you will not be helped."

Slide 3: Soul during Sleep and Death
"It is Allah who takes the souls at the time of their death, and those that do not die [He takes] during their sleep. Then He keeps those for which He has decreed death and releases the others."

Slide 4: Oneness of Allah
Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is, over all things, Disposer of affairs. To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth.

Slide 5: Surah Ghafir - The Forgiver
This Surah begins by emphasizing that the revelation of the Book is from Allah, the Exalted in Might, the Knowing, the Forgiver of sin, and the Accepter of repentance.

Slide 6: Forgiveness for Believers
The angels who bear the Throne and those around it glorify Allah and ask forgiveness for those who believe: "Our Lord, You have encompassed all things in mercy and knowledge, so forgive those who have repented."

Slide 7: Guidance and Misguidance
"That is Allah, your Lord, Creator of all things; there is no deity except Him, so how are you deluded?"

Slide 8: Victory for the Prophets
"Indeed, We will support Our messengers and those who believe during the life of this world and on the Day when the witnesses will stand."

Slide 9: Surah Fussilat - Guidance and Cure
"And if We had made it a foreign Qur'an, they would have said, 'Why are its verses not explained in detail?'... Say, 'It is, for those who believe, a guidance and a cure (Shifa).'"

Slide 10: Signs in the Horizons and Souls
"We will show them Our signs in the horizons and within themselves until it becomes clear to them that it is the truth."
