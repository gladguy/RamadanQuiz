      content: `Lesson: Juz 17 - Trials, Prophets, and the Last Day

Slide 1: Surah Al-Anbiya (The Prophets)
"Closer and closer to mankind comes their reckoning, while they heed not and turn away." This Surah highlights the lives and trials of various Prophets.

Slide 2: Creation with Purpose
"We did not create the heavens and the earth and that between them in play." Everything is created with a wise purpose.

Slide 3: Prophets as Humans
All Messengers sent by Allah were human beings who ate food and walked in the markets. They were chosen for their character and faith.

Slide 4: Ibrahim (A.S.) and the Idols
Ibrahim (A.S.) broke the idols of his people to show them they could not benefit or harm. He was thrown into a fire, but Allah commanded: "O fire, be coolness and safety for Ibrahim."

Slide 5: Testing through Good and Evil
"Every soul shall taste death. And We test you with evil and with good as a trial; and to Us you will be returned."

Slide 6: Lutf (A.S.) and Nuh (A.S.)
Allah saved Nuh (A.S.) and Lut (A.S.) from their corrupt nations. The stories of Prophets are lessons of patience and divine victory.

Slide 7: A Mercy for the Worlds
"And We have not sent you, [O Muhammad], except as a mercy to the worlds."

Slide 8: Surah Al-Hajj - The Last Hour
The earthquake of the Last Hour is a terrible thing. On that day, every nursing mother will forget her nursling, and every pregnant woman will drop her load.

Slide 9: Rituals of Hajj
Allah established the Hajj as a means for people to witness benefits for themselves and mention the name of Allah over the cattle He has provided.

Slide 10: Fighting to Defend
Permission to fight is given to those who are being fought because they have been wronged. Allah is certainly capable of granting them victory.
