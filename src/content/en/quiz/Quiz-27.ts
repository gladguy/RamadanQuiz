Slide 5: Two Seas and the Barrier
Allah has let free the two seas meeting [side by side]; between them is a barrier [so] neither of them transgresses.

Slide 9: Lending to Allah
"Who is it that would loan Allah a goodly loan so He will multiply it for him and he will have a noble reward?" Spending for Allah's sake is a profitable investment.

Slide 10: Submission of the Heart
"Has the time not come for those who have believed that their hearts should become humbly submissive at the remembrance of Allah and what has come down of the truth?"
