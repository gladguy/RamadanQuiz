      content: `Lesson: Juz 11 - Repentance and Divine Signs

Slide 1: Accepting Repentance
Allah is the one who accepts repentance from His servants and takes the charities. He is the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful.

Slide 2: The Muhajireen and Ansar
Allah is pleased with the first to embrace Islam among the Muhajireen (emigrants) and the Ansar (helpers) and those who followed them in goodness.

Slide 3: The Harmful Mosque (Masjid ad-Dirar)
Some hypocrites built a mosque to cause harm, disbelief, and division among the believers. Allah forbade the Prophet (S.A.W.) from praying in it.

Slide 4: A Profitable Exchange
Indeed, Allah has purchased from the believers their lives and their properties in exchange for Paradise. They fight in the cause of Allah.

Slide 5: Seeking Knowledge
It is not for the believers to go forth all at once. A group from every division should stay behind to obtain understanding in the religion and warn their people.

Slide 6: Surah Yunus - Signs of Allah
In the alternation of the night and the day and what Allah has created in the heavens and the earth are signs for a people who fear Allah.

Slide 7: Calculating Time
Allah made the sun a shining light and the moon a derived light and determined for it phases—that you may know the number of years and account of time.

Slide 8: Fragility of Human Life
When hardship touches man, he calls upon Allah. But when Allah removes his hardship, he passes on as if he had never called upon Him.

Slide 9: The Qur'an is not a Fabrication
This Qur'an is not such as could ever be produced by other than Allah; it is a confirmation of what was before it and a detailed explanation of the Scripture.

Slide 10: Nation of Yunus (A.S.)
When the people of Yunus (A.S.) believed, Allah removed from them the punishment of disgrace in the life of this world and let them enjoy for a time.
