      content: `Lesson: Juz 22 - Finality of Prophethood and Miracles of the Past

Slide 1: Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W.) as Khatamun Nabiyyin
"Muhammad is not the father of any one of your men, but he is the Messenger of Allah and the last (Seal) of the Prophets." No prophet will come after him.

Slide 2: Offering Salawat
"Indeed, Allah and His angels send blessings upon the Prophet. O you who have believed, ask [ Allah to confer] blessing upon him and ask [ Allah to grant him] peace."

Slide 3: Standing for Accountability
On the Day of Judgment, every soul will find what it has done. "And whoever does an atom's weight of good will see it, and whoever does an atom's weight of evil will see it."

Slide 4: Dawud (A.S.) and the Softened Iron
Allah blessed Dawud (A.S.) with many favors. He made the mountains and the birds glorify Allah with him and softened iron for him so he could make coats of mail.

Slide 5: The Passing of Sulayman (A.S.)
Sulayman (A.S.) passed away while leaning on his staff. The jinn did not realize he was dead until a termite ate through his staff and he fell. This showed that the jinn do not know the unseen.

Slide 6: The People of Saba
The people of Saba were provided with two beautiful gardens, but they turned away from gratitude. Allah sent upon them the flood of Arim as a punishment and transformed their gardens.

Slide 7: Guidance and Misguidance
Allah is the one who sends down rain to revive the dead land. Similarly, He sends revelation to revive the hearts. Guidance is a gift from Him.

Slide 8: Attributes of Angels
Surah Fatir begins by praising Allah, the Originator of the heavens and earth, who made the angels messengers with wings—two, three, four, or more.

Slide 9: Man's Need for Allah
"O mankind, you are those in need of Allah, while Allah is the Free of need, the Praiseworthy."

Slide 10: Value of Knowledge
"Only those fear Allah, from among His servants, who have knowledge." Knowledge leads to true God-consciousness (Taqwa).
