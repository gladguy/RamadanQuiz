      content: `Lesson: Juz 28 - Social Laws and Power of the Qur'an

Slide 1: Hearing the Complaint
The Juz begins with Surah Al-Mujadila, where Allah reveals that He heard the speech of the woman who pleaded with the Prophet (S.A.W.) concerning her husband. Allah is All-Hearing and All-Seeing.

Slide 2: Expiation for Sins
If a person commits 'Zihar' (a wrong way of divorcing), they must free a slave, fast for two consecutive months, or feed sixty poor people as an expiation before returning to their spouse.

Slide 3: Private Conversations
Allah is the fourth in a secret conversation of three, and the sixth in a conversation of five. He is with them wherever they are. Secret talks for evil are forbidden.

Slide 4: Surah Al-Hashr - Exile and Power
This Surah describes the exile of a Jewish tribe and the power of Allah. "Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth exalts Allah, and He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise."

Slide 5: Power of the Qur'an
"If We had sent down this Qur'an upon a mountain, you would have seen it humbled and coming apart from fear of Allah." These are parables for people to reflect upon.

Slide 6: The Names of Allah
The end of Surah Al-Hashr lists many beautiful names of Allah: The Creator, The Inventor, The Shaper, The Exalted in Might, The Wise.

Slide 7: Surah Al-Mumtahanah - The Tested
This Surah teaches the believers how to deal with those who oppose their faith and the importance of loyalty to Allah and His Messenger.

Slide 8: Victory and Commerce
Surah As-Saff mentions a "commerce" that saves from a painful punishment: "Believe in Allah and His Messenger and strive in the cause of Allah with your wealth and your lives."

Slide 9: Friday Prayer (Jumu'ah)
"O you who have believed, when [the adhan] is called for the prayer on the day of Jumu'ah [Friday], then proceed to the remembrance of Allah and leave business."

Slide 10: Surah At-Tahrim - Strengthening the Family
Believers are commanded to "protect yourselves and your families from a Fire whose fuel is people and stones." Allah mentions the examples of the wives of Nuh and Lut (who were disbelievers) and the wife of Pharaoh and Maryam (who were examples of faith).
