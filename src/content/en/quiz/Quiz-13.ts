Slide 1: Yusuf (A.S.)'s Success in Egypt
Allah granted Yusuf (A.S.) authority over the storehouses of the land. He was reunited with his brothers, and instead of taking revenge, he forgave them, saying, "No reproach shall be upon you today."

Even at the height of his power, Yusuf (A.S.) remained humble and prayed, "Creator of the heavens and earth, You are my protector in this world and the Hereafter. Cause me to die as a Muslim and join me with the righteous."

The parents and brothers of Yusuf (A.S.) came to Egypt and settled there. Yusuf (A.S.) raised his parents upon the throne, and they all fell in prostration to Allah in gratitude.

Slide 4: Surah Ar-Ra'd - Power of Allah
Allah is the one who raised the heavens without pillars that you can see. He is the one who spread the earth and placed in it mountains and rivers.
