      content: `Lesson: Juz 26 - Social Manners and Deep Reflection

Slide 1: Reaching Maturity
Allah mentions the stage when a person reaches full strength and reaches forty years. At this age, one should pray, "My Lord, enable me to be grateful for Your favor which You have bestowed upon me and upon my parents and to work righteousness of which You will approve."

Slide 2: Truth of Revelation
"We have not sent you except as a warner and a giver of glad tidings." The Qur'an is a reminder for all who have a heart or give ear while they are heedless.

Slide 3: Surah Muhammad - Sincerity in Faith
"Those who believe and do righteous deeds... He will remove from them their misdeeds and amend their condition." Real success is tied to faith and action.

Slide 4: Surah Al-Fath - The Victory
Allah granted a "clear victory" (the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah) which led to peace and the further spread of Islam. Allah sent down tranquility into the hearts of the believers.

Slide 5: Believers in the Gospel
The believers are described in the Gospel (Injil) as "a seed which sends forth its shoot, then strengthens it, then becomes thick and stands upon its stem, delighting the sowers."

Slide 6: Surah Al-Hujurat - Social Ethics
This Surah is a manual of manners. It teaches respect for the Prophet (S.A.W.) and guidelines for social harmony. When a disobedient person brings news, verify it before acting upon it.

Slide 7: Brotherhood and Peace
"The believers are but brothers, so make settlement between your brothers." Avoid mockery, insulting one another, and calling each other by offensive nicknames.

Slide 8: Evils of Backbiting and Suspicion
"O you who have believed, avoid much [negative] suspicion... And do not spy or backbite each other. Would one of you like to eat the flesh of his brother when dead? You would detest it."

Slide 9: Equality and Piety (Taqwa)
"Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous (God-fearing) of you." Honor is not based on wealth or race, but on Taqwa.

Slide 10: Surah Qaf - Divine Monitoring
"Man does not utter any word except that with him is an observer prepared [to record]." Every word is monitored by angels (Raqib and Atid).
