      content: `Lesson: Juz 19 - Servants of the Merciful and Wisdom of Prophets

Slide 1: Ibadur-Rahman (Servants of the Merciful)
The ending of Surah Al-Furqan describes the qualities of the true servants of Allah: they walk humbly, respond to the ignorant with "Peace," spend the night in prostration, and avoid extravagance and stinginess.

Slide 2: Regret on Judgment Day
The wrongdoer will bite his hands and say, "Oh, I wish I had taken a path with the Messenger! Woe to me! I wish I had not taken that one as a friend." Choosing good companions is vital.

Slide 3: Surah Ash-Shu'ara (The Poets)
Allah reassures the Prophet (S.A.W.) and recounts the stories of Musa, Ibrahim, Nuh, Hud, Salih, Lut, and Shu'ayb (A.S.) to show that truth always prevails over falsehood.

Slide 4: Story of Musa (A.S.) and the Sea
When trapped between the sea and Pharaoh's army, Musa (A.S.) said, "Indeed, with me is my Lord; He will guide me." Allah split the sea as a miracle.

Slide 5: Ibrahim (A.S.) and his Father
Ibrahim (A.S.) asked his father and people, "What do you worship?" They replied, "We worship idols." Ibrahim (A.S.) countered with the power of his Lord, who created him, feeds him, and will give him life again.

Slide 6: Surah An-Naml (The Ant)
This Surah highlights the unique blessings given to Dawud and Sulayman (A.S.), including the knowledge of the language of birds and animals.

Slide 7: Solomon (A.S.) and the Ant
As Sulayman (A.S.) traveled with his army of jinn, men, and birds, an ant warned her community: "O ants, enter your dwellings that you not be crushed by Sulayman and his soldiers." Sulayman (A.S.) smiled in gratitude.

Slide 8: The Hoopoe (Hudhud) and Queen of Sheba
The Hoopoe brought news to Sulayman (A.S.) of a queen who ruled over a great nation (Sheba) but worshipped the sun besides Allah.

Slide 9: Wisdom of Sulayman (A.S.)
Sulayman (A.S.) did not care for the queen's gifts but invited her to submit to Allah. She eventually realized her error and said, "I submit with Sulayman to Allah, Lord of the worlds."

Slide 10: Signs in the Universe
Allah shows His signs in the creation of heavens and earth, the falling of rain, and the growth of gardens. "Is there a deity with Allah? Nay, but they are a people who scribe equals [to Him]."
