Slide 1: Victory of the Small Group
The story of Talut and Jalut (Goliath) proves that a small group can defeat a large one by Allah's permission if they have patience and trust.

Slide 2: Ayatul Kursi (The Verse of the Throne)
The greatest verse in the Qur'an. It describes Allah's absolute sovereignty, eternal life, and infinite knowledge. "His Kursi extends over the heavens and the earth."

Slide 3: No Compulsion in Religion
Truth is distinct from falsehood. One who rejects false deities and believes in Allah has grasped the most trustworthy handhold.

Slide 4: Reviving the Dead
The stories of Uzair (A.S.) and Ibrahim (A.S.) questioning how Allah gives life to the dead demonstrate Allah's power to resurrect all on the Day of Judgment.

Slide 5: Sincerity in Charity
Charity must be given for Allah's sake alone. Reminding the recipient of the favor or causing them harm destroys the reward of the deed.

Slide 6: Prohibiting Interest (Riba)
Allah has permitted trade and forbidden interest. Those who consume Riba will stand on the Day of Judgment like one being beaten by Shaitan into insanity.

Slide 7: Writing Contracts
The longest verse (2:282) emphasizes documenting debts and transactions in writing to ensure justice and avoid disputes.

Slide 8: The Prophet's Prayer
The end of Surah Al-Baqarah contains powerful prayers: "Our Lord, do not impose upon us a burden like that which You imposed upon those before us."

Slide 9: Firmness in Truth
Allah is the Patron of those who believe; He brings them out of darkness into light.

Slide 10: Comparative Creation
The creation of Isa (A.S.) without a father is compared to the creation of Adam (A.S.) from dust. "Be," and he was.
