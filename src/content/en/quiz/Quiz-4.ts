Slide 1: The First House of Worship
The Kaaba in Makkah was the first house established for mankind's worship. It is a source of guidance and blessing.

Slide 2: Unity in Faith
Believers are commanded to hold fast to the "Rope of Allah" (the Qur'an and His religion) together and not become divided.

Slide 3: Martyrdom and Life
Do not think of those killed in the way of Allah as dead; they are alive, finding sustenance with their Lord.

Slide 4: Lessons from Uhud
The Battle of Uhud was a trial to distinguish between the true believers and the hypocrites. Victory comes from obedience.

Slide 5: Patience and Steadfastness
Believers must be patient and excel in patience. Success in this life and the hereafter depends on God-consciousness (Taqwa).

Slide 6: Rights of Orphans
Guard the property of orphans and do not consume it unjustly. Treat them with kindness and fairness.

Slide 7: Inheritance Laws
Allah has specified shares in inheritance for both men and women. This system ensures justice within the family and society.
