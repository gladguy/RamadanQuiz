Slide 1: Musa (A.S.) and the Fire
Allah called Musa (A.S.) from the side of the mount: "O Musa, indeed it is I, Allah, the Exalted in Might, the Wise." Musa (A.S.) was given the miracles of the staff and his radiant hand to confront Pharaoh.

Slide 2: Confronting the Tyrant
Musa (A.S.) called Pharaoh to the worship of Allah, but Pharaoh was arrogant and claimed, "I am your most exalted lord." He threatened to imprison Musa (A.S.), but Musa showed him the clear signs of Allah.

Slide 3: Surah Al-Qasas - The Story of Musa's Birth
Allah reveals the details of Musa's birth—how his mother was inspired to cast him into the river, and how he was brought up in the palace of his enemy, Pharaoh, as part of Allah's plan.

Slide 4: Help for the Oppressed
"And We wanted to confer favor upon those who were oppressed in the land and make them leaders and make them inheritors."

Slide 5: The Story of Qarun (Korah)
Qarun was from the people of Musa but was extremely wealthy and arrogant. He claimed his wealth was due to his own knowledge. Allah caused the earth to swallow him and his home.

Slide 6: Guidance is from Allah
"Indeed, [O Muhammad], you do not guide whom you like, but Allah guides whom He wills. And He is most knowing of the [rightly] guided."

Slide 7: Surah Al-Ankabut (The Spider)
The Surah begins with a test of faith: "Do the people think that they will be left to say, 'We believe' and they will not be tried?"

Slide 8: The Spider's House
"The example of those who take allies other than Allah is like that of the spider who takes a home. And indeed, the flimsiest of houses is the spider's house, if they only knew."

Slide 9: Striving in Allah's Path
"And those who strive for Us—We will surely guide them to Our ways. And indeed, Allah is with the doers of good."

Slide 10: Prayer and Evil
"Recite, [O Muhammad], what has been revealed to you of the Book and establish prayer. Indeed, prayer prohibits immorality and wrongdoing."
